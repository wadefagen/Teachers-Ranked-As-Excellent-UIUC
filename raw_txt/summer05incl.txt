UIUC OFFICIAL NOTICE

                             AN INCOMPLETE LIST OF TEACHERS
                         RANKED AS EXCELLENT BY THEIR STUDENTS
                                       SUMMER 2005

                         (Based on Data Collected Summer 2005)

The results for the SUMMER 2005 administration of student ratings of
instructors are included in this list. Results are based on Instructor and
Course Evaluation (ICES) questionnaire forms maintained by Measurement and
Evaluation, Center for Teaching Excellence.

More than one-half of the faculty are estimated to have used student rating
forms, but a substantial number have not. Therefore, the report is
necessarily incomplete. Instructors who did not have students evaluate their
classes or chose to use a form other than those reported here have no
opportunity to be included. For some instructors who did use these forms,
there is also the possibility that they received ratings that were not truly
representative of their teaching ability. For these reasons, we have adopted
the title “An Incomplete List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their
Students.” The results are presented in department alphabetical order.
Criteria for inclusion follows.


PREPARATION OF RESULTS

This list is based on ICES forms filled in by students during the Summer
semester of 2005. Only those instructors who gave out ICES forms at least
once during this time period and who released their data for publication are
included in the list.

Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used, and at
least five students must have responded in each class.

Special Notice: In the past, to be included on the list instructors needed to
be rated among the top 30% across campus in their respective Elective-Mixed-
Required course group. Beginning with the Fall 2000 semester ICES results,
our office has shifted to a set of criterion cutoffs for the Incomplete List.
Below are the ICES average (mean) results needed to make the Incomplete List
of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students. Faculty must meet the
requirements for both Item 1 (“Rate the Instructor’s Overall Teaching
Effectiveness”) and Item 2 (“Rate the Overall Quality of this Course”).
Teaching assistants must meet the requirement for only Item 1.

          ICES Item #1 (Instructor’s Overall Teaching Effectiveness)
                              Required    Mixed  Elective
                               Course    Course   Course
                     Faculty     4.4       4.5     4.6
                     TAs         4.3       4.4     4.5

                   ICES Item #2 (Overall Quality of Course)
                              Required   Mixed   Elective
                               Course   Course    Course
                     Faculty     4.3      4.4      4.5
                     TAs        -na-     -na-      -na-

Outstanding ratings (marked with an asterisk) are still awarded to
instructors who obtained ratings of “High” (top 10% on each item for faculty
and top 10% on item one for teaching assistants).
INTERPRETATION OF LIST

Instructors' names are listed alphabetically within each department. The
specific courses that were used in the ratings are indicated by the course
numbers that follow the instructor's name.

      The symbols used in the list have the following meaning:
            T.A. - Teaching Assistant
             *   - The instructor ratings were outstanding.

This list of excellent teachers was compiled by staff at Measurement and
Evaluation of the Center for Teaching Excellence. More information about the
report may be obtained by contacting Measurement and Evaluation, 247 Armory
Building, 333-3490. Recent incomplete lists can be found on the Web at
