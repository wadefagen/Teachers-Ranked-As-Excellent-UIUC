             LIST OF TEACHERS RANKED AS EXCELLENT BY THEIR STUDENTS
                                   SUMMER 2007

                        (Based on Data Collected Summer 2007)

The results for the SUMMER 2007 administration of student ratings of instructors
are included in this list. Results are based on Instructor and Course
Evaluation (ICES) questionnaire forms maintained by Measurement and Evaluation,
Center for Teaching Excellence.

More than one-half of the faculty is estimated to have used student rating
forms, but a substantial number have not. Therefore, the report is necessarily
incomplete. Instructors who did not have students evaluate their classes or
chose to use a form other than those reported here have no opportunity to be
included. For some instructors who did use these forms, there is also the
possibility that they received ratings that were not truly representative of
their teaching ability. For these reasons, in the past we adopted the title “An
Incomplete List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students.” These
reasons still hold and the list is still “incomplete” but we have taken
Incomplete out of the title. The results are presented in department
alphabetical order. Criteria for inclusion follows.


PREPARATION OF RESULTS

This list is based on ICES forms filled in by students during the Summer
semester of 2007. Only those instructors who gave out ICES forms at least once
during this time period and who released their data for publication are included
in the list.

Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used, and at least
five students must have responded in each class.

Special Notice: In the past, to be included on the list instructors needed to be
rated among the top 30% across campus in their respective Elective-Mixed-
Required course group. Beginning with the Fall 2000 semester ICES results, our
office has shifted to a set of criterion cutoffs for the List. Below are the
ICES average (mean) results needed to make the List of Teachers Ranked as
Excellent by Their Students. Faculty must meet the requirements for both Item 1
(“Rate the Instructor’s Overall Teaching Effectiveness”) and Item 2 (“Rate the
Overall Quality of this Course”). Teaching assistants must meet the requirement
for only Item 1.

           ICES Item #1 (Instructor’s Overall Teaching Effectiveness)
                               Required Mixed     Elective
                               Course    Course Course
                      Faculty 4.4        4.5      4.6
                      TAs      4.3       4.4      4.5

                       ICES Item #2 (Overall Quality of Course)
                                  Required Mixed    Elective
                                  Course    Course Course
                         Faculty 4.3        4.4     4.5

                                     Summer 2007
Outstanding ratings (marked with an asterisk) are still awarded to instructors
who obtained ratings of “High” (top 10% on each item for faculty and top 10% on
item one for teaching assistants).


INTERPRETATION OF LIST

Instructors' names are listed alphabetically within each department. The
specific courses that were used in the ratings are indicated by the course
numbers that follow the instructor's name.

      The symbols used in the list have the following meaning:
         T.A. - Teaching Assistant
            * - The instructor ratings were outstanding.

This list of excellent teachers was compiled by staff at Measurement and
Evaluation of the Center for Teaching Excellence. More information about the
report may be obtained by contacting Measurement and Evaluation, 247 Armory
Building, 333-3490. Recent lists can be found on the Web at
