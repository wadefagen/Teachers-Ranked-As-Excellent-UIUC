UIUC OFFICIAL NOTICE
                             AN INCOMPLETE LIST OF TEACHERS
                          RANKED AS EXCELLENT BY THEIR STUDENTS
                                          Summer 2004
                              (Based on Data Collected Summer 2004)
The results for the Summer 2004 administration of student ratings of instructors are included in this
list. Results are based on Instructor and Course Evaluation (ICES) questionnaire forms maintained
by Measurement and Evaluation, Center for Teaching Excellence.
More than one-half of the faculty are estimated to have used student rating forms, but a substantial
number have not. Therefore, the report is necessarily incomplete. Instructors who did not have
students evaluate their classes or chose to use a form other than those reported here have no
opportunity to be included. For some instructors who did use these forms, there is also the
possibility that they received ratings which were not truly representative of their teaching ability.
For these reasons, we have adopted the title "An Incomplete List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent
by Their Students." The results are presented in department alphabetical order. Criteria for
inclusion follows.
PREPARATION OF RESULTS
This list is based on ICES forms filled in by students during the Summer semester of 2004. Only
those instructors who gave out ICES forms at least once during this time period and who released
their data for publication are included in the list.
Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used, and at least five students must
have responded in each class.
Special Notice: In the past, to be included on the list instructors needed to be rated among the top
30% across campus in their respective Elective-Mixed-Required course group. Beginning with the
Fall 2000 semester ICES results, our office has shifted to a set of criterion cutoffs for the
Incomplete List. Below are the ICES average (mean) results needed to make the Incomplete List of
Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students. Faculty must meet the requirements for both Item
1 ("Rate the Instructor's Overall Teaching Effectiveness") and Item 2 ("Rate the Overall Quality of
this Course"). Teaching assistants must meet the requirement for only Item 1.

Outstanding ratings (marked with an asterisk) are still awarded to instructors who obtained ratings
of "High" (top 10% on each item for faculty and top 10% on item one for teaching assistants).
INTERPRETATION OF LIST
