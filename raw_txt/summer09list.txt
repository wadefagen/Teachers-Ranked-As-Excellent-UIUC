UIUC OFFICIAL NOTICE                       Research Memorandum #287

       LIST OF TEACHERS RANKED AS EXCELLENT BY THEIR STUDENTS
                             SUMMER 2009

                (Based on Data Collected SUMMER 2009)

The results for the SUMMER 2009 administration of student ratings
of instructors are included in this list. Results are based on
Instructor and Course Evaluation (ICES) questionnaire forms
maintained by Measurement and Evaluation, Center for Teaching
Excellence.

More than one-half of the faculty is estimated to have used
student rating forms, but a substantial number have not.
Therefore, the report is necessarily incomplete. Instructors who
did not have students evaluate their classes or chose to use a
form other than those reported here have no opportunity to be
included. For some instructors who did use these forms, there is
also the possibility that they received ratings that were not
truly representative of their teaching ability. For these
reasons, in the past we adopted the title “An Incomplete List of
Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students.” These reasons
still hold and the list is still ‘incomplete’ but we have taken
“Incomplete” out of the title. The results are presented in
department alphabetical order. Criteria for inclusion follows.


PREPARATION OF RESULTS

This list is based on ICES forms filled in by students during the
Summer semester of 2009. Only those instructors who gave out ICES
forms at least once during this time period and who released their
data for publication are included in the list.

Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used,
and at least five students must have responded in each class.

Special Notice: In the past, to be included on the list
instructors needed to be rated among the top 30% across campus in
their respective Elective-Mixed-Required course group. Beginning
with the Fall 2000 semester ICES results, our office has shifted
to a set of criterion cutoffs for the List. Below are the ICES
average (mean) results needed to make the List of Teachers Ranked
as Excellent by Their Students. Faculty must meet the
requirements for both Item 1 (“Rate the Instructor’s Overall
Teaching Effectiveness”) and Item 2 (“Rate the Overall Quality of


                             Summer 2009
this Course”).   Teaching assistants must meet the requirement for
only Item 1.

    ICES Item #1 (Instructor’s Overall Teaching Effectiveness)
                        Required    Mixed  Elective
                         Course    Course   Course
               Faculty     4.4       4.5     4.6
               TAs         4.3       4.4     4.5

              ICES Item #2 (Overall   Quality of Course)
                         Required      Mixed  Elective
                          Course      Course   Course
                Faculty     4.3         4.4     4.5
                TAs        -na-        -na-     -na-

Outstanding ratings (marked with an asterisk) are still awarded to
instructors who obtained ratings of “High” (top 10% on each item
for faculty and top 10% on item one for teaching assistants).


INTERPRETATION OF LIST

Instructors' names are listed alphabetically within each
department. The specific courses that were used in the ratings
are indicated by the course numbers that follow the instructor's
name.

     The symbols used in the list have the following meaning:
     T.A. - Teaching Assistant
        * - The instructor ratings were outstanding.

This list of excellent teachers was compiled by staff at
Measurement and Evaluation of the Center for Teaching Excellence.
