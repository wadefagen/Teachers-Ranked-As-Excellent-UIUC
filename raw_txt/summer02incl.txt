UIUC OFFICIAL NOTICE                                                           Research Memorandum #266

                               AN INCOMPLETE LIST OF TEACHERS
                            RANKED AS EXCELLENT BY THEIR STUDENTS
                                                SUMMER 2002

                                   (Based on Data Collected Summer 2002)

The results for the SUMMER 2002 administration of student ratings of instructors are included in this list.
Results are based on Instructor and Course Evaluation (ICES) questionnaire forms maintained by the
Division of Measurement and Evaluation, Office of Instructional Resources.

More than one-half of the faculty is estimated to have used student rating forms, but a substantial number
have not. Therefore, the report is necessarily incomplete. Instructors who did not have students evaluate
their classes or chose to use a form other than those reported here have no opportunity to be included. For
some instructors who did use these forms, there is also the possibility that they received ratings that were not
truly representative of their teaching ability. For these reasons, we have adopted the title “An Incomplete
List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students.” The results are presented in department
alphabetical order. Criteria for inclusion follows.

PREPARATION OF RESULTS

This list is based on ICES forms filled in by students during the Summer semester of 2002. Only those
instructors who gave out ICES forms at least once during this time period and who released their data for
publication are included in the list.

Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used, and at least five students must
have responded in each class.

Special Notice : In the past, to be included on the list instructors needed to be rated among the top
30% across campus in their respective Elective-Mixed-Required course group. Beginning with the
Fall 2000 semester ICES results, our office has shifted to a set of criterion cutoffs for the
Incomplete List. Below are the ICES average (mean) results needed to make the Incomplete List of
Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students. Faculty must meet the requirements for both Item
1 (“Rate the Instructor’s Overall Teaching Effectiveness”) and Item 2 (“Rate the Overall Quality of
this Course”). Teaching assistants must meet the requirement for only Item 1.

                      ICES Item #1 (Instructor’s Overall Teaching Effectiveness)
                                        Required Mixed        Elective
                                         Course     Course     Course
                              Faculty      4.4        4.5        4.6
                              TAs          4.3        4.4        4.5

                                ICES Item #2 (Overall Quality of Course)
                                         Required     Mixed      Elective
                                          Course      Course      Course
                               Faculty       4.3        4.4         4.5
                               TAs          -na-       -na-        -na-
Outstanding ratings (marked with an asterisk) are still awarded to instructors who obtained ratings of “High” (top 10%
on each item for faculty and top 10% on item one for teaching assistants).


INTERPRETATION OF LIST

Instructors' names are listed alphabetically within each department. The specific courses that were used in
the ratings are indicated by the course numbers which follow the instructor's name.

        The symbols used in the list have the following meaning:
        T.A. - Teaching Assistant
         * - The instructor ratings were outstanding.
This list of excellent teachers was compiled by staff at the Division of Measurement and Evaluation of the
Office of Instructional Resources. More information about the report may be obtained by contacting the
Division of Measurement and Evaluation, 247 Armory Building, 333-3490. Recent incomplete lists can be
