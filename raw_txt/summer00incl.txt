UIUC OFFICIAL NOTICE                          Research Memorandum # 260
                 AN INCOMPLETE LIST OF TEACHERS
             RANKED AS EXCELLENT BY THEIR STUDENTS
                              Summer 2000
                  (Based on Data Collected Summer 2000)

The results for the SUMMER 2000 administration of student ratings of instructors are
included in this list. Results are based on Instructor and Course Evaluation (ICES)
questionnaire forms maintained by the Division of Measurement and Evaluation, Center
for Teaching Excellence.

More than one-half of the faculty is estimated to have used student rating forms, but a
substantial number have not. Therefore, the report is necessarily incomplete. Instructors
who did not have students evaluate their classes or chose to use a form other than those
reported here have no opportunity to be included. For some instructors who did use these
forms, there is also the possibility that they received ratings which were not truly
representative of their teaching ability. For these reasons, we have adopted the title "An
Incomplete List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students." The results are
presented in department alphabetical order. Criteria for inclusion follows.

PREPARATION OF RESULTS

This list is based on ICES forms filled in by students during the Summer semester of
2000. Only those instructors who gave out ICES forms at least once during this time
period and who released their data for publication are included in the list.

Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used, and at least five
students must have responded in each class. Each faculty member whose name appears
on the list received average (mean) ratings of "High Avg" or "High" (top 30%) by
university norm comparisons on both of these general items: "Rate the Instructor's
Overall Teaching Effectiveness" (Item 1), and "Rate the Overall Quality of This Course"
(Item 2). For teaching assistants, only "Rate the Instructor's Overall Teaching
Effectiveness" results were used (top 30%). Norm comparisons are based on a joint
consideration of instructor rank (TA versus other faculty) and the required-elective nature
of the course (required courses, elective courses, and those in between). Outstanding
ratings were awarded to instructors who obtained ratings of "High" (top 10% on each
item for faculty and top 10% on one item for teaching assistants).

INTERPRETATION OF LIST

Instructors' names are listed alphabetically within each department. The specific courses
which were used in the ratings are indicated by the course numbers which follow the
instructor's name.

The symbols used in the list have the following meaning:
      T.A. - Teaching Assistant
      * - The instructor ratings were outstanding.

This list of excellent teachers was compiled by staff at the Division of Measurement and
Evaluation of the Center for Teaching Excellence. More information about the report
may be obtained by contacting the Division of Measurement and Evaluation, 247 Armory
Building, 333-3490. Recent incomplete lists can be found on the Web at
