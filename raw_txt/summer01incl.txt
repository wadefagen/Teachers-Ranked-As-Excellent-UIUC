UIUC OFFICIAL NOTICE                                                               Research Memorandum #263

                                 AN INCOMPLETE LIST OF TEACHERS
                              RANKED AS EXCELLENT BY THEIR STUDENTS
                                                   SUMMER 2001

                                     (Based on Data Collected Summer 2001)

The results for the SUMMER 2001 administration of student ratings of instructors are included in this list. Results are
based on Instructor and Course Evaluation (ICES) questionnaire forms maintained by the Division of Measurement and
Evaluation, Office of Instructional Resources.

More than one-half of the faculty are estimated to have used student rating forms, but a substantial number have not.
Therefore, the report is necessarily incomplete. Instructors who did not have students evaluate their classes or chose to
use a form other than those reported here have no opportunity to be included. For some instructors who did use these
forms, there is also the possibility that they received ratings which were not truly representative of their teaching ability.
For these reasons, we have adopted the title “An Incomplete List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students.”
The results are presented in department alphabetical order. Criteria for inclusion follows.

PREPARATION OF RESULTS

This list is based on ICES forms filled in by students during the Summer semester of 2001. Only those instructors who
gave out ICES forms at least once during this time period and who released their data for publication are included in the
list.

Only numerical data from the ICES questionnaire results were used, and at least five students must have
responded in each class.

Special Notice : In the past, to be included on the list instructors needed to be rated among the top 30% across
campus in their respective Elective-Mixed-Required course group. Beginning with the Fall 2000 semester ICES
results, our office has shifted to a set of criterion cutoffs for the Incomplete List. Below are the ICES average
(mean) results needed to make the Incomplete List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students. Faculty
must meet the requirements for both Item 1 (“Rate the Instructor’s Overall Teaching Effectiveness”) and Item 2
(“Rate the Overall Quality of this Course”). Teaching assistants must meet the requirement for only Item 1.

                               ICES Item #1 (Instructor’s Overall Teaching Effectiveness)
                                                 Required Mixed         Elective
                                                  Course     Course     Course

                                         ICES Item #2 (Overall Quality of Course)
                                                  Required     Mixed      Elective
                                                   Course      Course      Course
                                        Faculty      4.3         4.4         4.5
                                        TAs         -na-        -na-        -na-

Outstanding ratings (marked with an asterisk) are still awarded to instructors who obtained ratings of “High” (top 10% on each item
for faculty and top 10% on item one for teaching assistants).


INTERPRETATION OF LIST

Instructors' names are listed alphabetically within each department. The specific courses which were used in the ratings
are indicated by the course numbers which follow the instructor's name.
       The symbols used in the list have the following meaning:
       T.A. - Teaching Assistant
        * - The instructor ratings were outstanding.
This list of excellent teachers was compiled by staff at the Division of Measurement and Evaluation of the Office of
Instructional Resources. More information about the report may be obtained by contacting the Division of Measurement
and Evaluation, 247 Armory Building, 333-3490. Recent incomplete lists can be found on the Web at
